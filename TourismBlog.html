                The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries and worship-halls of different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock. <span class="txt-color"> caves also present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.</span>

                        Throughout the 8th century, the temple was founded, starting in the reign of Krishna I, and the solid rock was reduced from 150 thousand to 200 thousand tonnes. The complex has a length of roughly 164 feet, a wide diameter of 108 feet. It has sculpted monoliths and corridors, with steps, walls, windows and various fixed screens. The scene of Vishnu, which has become the man-lion and battles a demon, is among its most famous decorations. Just beyond the gate, in Shiva’s bull, Nandi ‘s central courtyard is a memorial.

                        <span class="txt-color">Carvings of the elephants and other creatures on the walls of the building, on the second floor. The 10-headed demon King Ravana trembling in a display of power at Kailasa Mountain is one of the representations in the rooms. The temple often presents pornographic and voluptuous depictions of the Hindu divinities and mythological characters. Some features, such as a rocky footbridge that once joined two top-level thresholds, have been damaged or destroyed over centuries.</span>
